# Error Handling Instructions
1. With every request I make, ensure that you quickly check the **console log.md** file. Search for the dashed line and check if the 
first line says 'X:' or 'Y:'. If it says 'X:', then you should handle the error since that's a new error message from the console.
2. If the first line says 'Y:', then you should not handle the error since it's a known error message that you already handled before.
3. If you handle an 'X:' marked error, you should update the **console log.md** by replacing the 'X:' with 'Y:'.
