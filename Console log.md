# How to use this file
When the error message(s) below the dashed line start with an 'X:', that's the indicator that we have an unhandled error message that requires your attention.

In response, after you have handled the error message, you (CoPilot code) need to replace the X: with a Y:. That way if the console log has a Y: in front of it, you know you can ignore it cause it's been handled.
